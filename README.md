2. SEO Optimization:
Search engine optimization (SEO) strategies are implemented to ensure that the website's content is easily discoverable by search engines. Proper HTML structure, metadata, and semantic elements contribute to improved search engine visibility.

3. Code Reuse:
A key aspect of the project is the effective reuse of code. Modular and reusable code components are employed to streamline development and enhance maintainability.

4. Native JavaScript and jQuery:
The project extensively utilizes both Native JavaScript and jQuery to create interactive and dynamic features. These technologies contribute to the smooth functioning of the website and enhance user interaction.

5. Regular Expressions:
Regular expressions are skillfully employed to validate and manipulate user input, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

6. Diverse Form Elements:
The project includes a form that integrates a minimum of three distinct form elements, such as text fields, dropdown lists, and radio button lists. These elements provide users with diverse interaction options.

7. Varied Code Implementation:
The project showcases code diversity by incorporating a range of functionalities and interactions throughout the website. This approach demonstrates a well-rounded skill set in web programming.

8. Dynamic Content Display (AJAX and JSON):
Dynamic content is a core feature of the project, achieved through AJAX requests and JSON data. Complex nesting of JSON objects ensures that data is displayed dynamically and accurately on the website.

9. Error Handling:
The project demonstrates robust error handling mechanisms that provide users with clear and informative error messages. This enhances the user experience by offering helpful guidance in case of errors.
